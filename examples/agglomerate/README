A series of scripts that prepare and agglomerate packing, i.e. cohesive elastic aggregates, each composed of dense particle packing

A general idea:
- create a "macro" particles as large spheres using makeCloud
- "mesh" these macroparticles with smaller spheres
- run compression to make the loose packing denser
- save the result
- use the resulting packing in actual simulation

Scripts in order to run:
- makeCloud.py  ... a script to prepare loose packing of macro particles using makeCloud
- divide.py     ... a script to divide the macro particles from previous step into clump of particles
- compress.py   ... a script to create dense packing of agglomerates
- simulation.py ... use of prepared dense packing of agglomerates in a simple simulation
